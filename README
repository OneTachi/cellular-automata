Cellular Automata -
	
-> How we used it (dungeon generation)
	Cellular Automata is used in a variety of different ways from studying fluid dynamics to creating generative music.
	We've decided to use it for simple dungeon generating for video games or a tabletop game like Dungeons and Dragons.	

	We start by generating a grid (dungeon) of a set size. This dungeon is filled entirely with walls.
	Then, we generate random "noise" in the top left of the dungeon. This noise flips random tiles from 
	walls to floors. Then, a set of rules is applied to the whole dungeon. This causes the floors to spread 
	outwards and, with enough generations, form something that looks like a dungeon. 

-> Our ruleset
	If a tile has: 
		-> 0 neighbors that are floors then nothing happens, 
		-> Between 1 and 4 neighbors that are floors then tile becomes a Floor, 
		-> 5 to 8 neighbors that are floors then tile becomes a wall
	We found if we changed the first two rules we could create a maze
		-> If we only had a tile become a floor with exactly three neighboring floors, and do nothing when
		-> it had 0,1,2,or 4 neighbors then it would look like a maze. 

-> Findings/Limitations
	-> This doesn't work without any noise, however it will work with just a single pixel that is floor. 
	-> Noise is set always to spawn in a square and in the top left corner. 
	-> Currently there is a gap between rows that looks like an empty space when in reality it is just the space 
		between walls. Printing could look cleaner if we could implement a full box character for walls. 
	-> The dungeon expands in generations. We can watch the rulset be implemented once we set the noise.
	-> This lets us observe patterns in the generation, and see how it could be tweaked for different uses.
	-> Computation for this algorithm is O(n^2) where n = rows/cols assuming rows = cols. This is because the algorithm applies a rule to every cell in the grid. 
-> Process
	We started by creating the basics: just a grid with 1's and 0's. We then created a function to get a certain tiles
	neighborhood, since that was often used in example cellular automata rulesets. Following this we decided on a basic 
	ruleset: If a tile had between 0 and 4 neighboring floor tiles: it was a floor, otherwise it was a wall. This ruleset
	worked when the noise grid covered the entire dungeon, but had limitations. If we had a small noise grid it would 
	cause the non noise grid parts of the dungeon that were all walls to all flip to be all floors, and then flip again
	each subsequent generation. This eventually overtook the noise, and was not what we wanted. 
	So instead we added an extra rule: when a tile had 0 neighboring floors, nothing happened. This fixed our problem,
	and we generated some grids that looked like actual dungeons.

-> How to run the program
	If you haven't already, install Make onto your system! 
	
	Clone the repository and compile the code by typing `make` onto your terminal/console.
	Then type in `./automata` to run a stock dungeon.
	
	You can customize your dungeon like this:
	`./automata rows cols generations noise_grid_size ratio` -- Note: Use only integers. Higher generations and size (rows/cols) will increase computation time, especially size.
	Ratio is a number 0-100 with 100 creating a floor no matter what in the noise grid. 

	If you are on linux or would like to see the grid without the space between rows do:
	`/automata rows cols generations noise_grid_size ratio 0`
